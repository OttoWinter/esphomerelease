**Hi! I'm Otto Winter, the author and main developer of ESPHome.**

Developing ESPHome takes a lot of time. There's a lot of things that go
into developing and maintaining an open-source project: from developing new features, fixing bugs,
answering questions to maintaining servers, preparing releases and moderating discussions.
And of course all of the hardware for new features has to be bought too. I'm a student
so I really appreciate donations :)

**You can support ESPHome's development** by becoming a Patron or a one-time contribution
with PayPal.
